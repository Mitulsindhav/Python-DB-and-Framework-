   *** 7. MVT Pattern Architecture  ***

(1) Django’s MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it 
    handles request-response cycles.
 -  Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern, which is 
    a variation of the MVC architecture:

 - Model – Represents the database structure and handles data logic.

 - View – Contains business logic, processes user requests, and 
   interacts with models.

 - Template – Handles the presentation layer, rendering HTML 
   content dynamically.

 - Request-Response Cycle in Django
 - User sends a request – The browser sends an HTTP request to the 
   Django server.

 - URL Routing (urls.py) – Django’s URL dispatcher maps the request to 
   the appropriate view.

 - View Processing (views.py) – The view fetches or processes data, 
   often interacting with the model.

 - Template Rendering (templates/) – If needed, the view renders an 
   HTML template with dynamic data.

 - Response Sent to User – The processed response (HTML, JSON, etc.) 
   is returned to the browser.
