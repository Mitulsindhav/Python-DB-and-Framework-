    *** 20. Google Maps API ***

(1)Integrating Google Maps API into Django projects.
 1.What is the Google Maps API?
 - The Google Maps API is a set of services provided by Google that 
   allow developers to integrate location-based features like:

 - Interactive maps

 - Geocoding (converting addresses to coordinates)

 - Reverse geocoding (coordinates to address)

 - Place search and autocomplete

 - Directions and distance matrix

 2.Purpose of Integrating Google Maps in Django
 - Show maps in your web app (e.g., property listings, business locations)

 - Auto-fill addresses using Google’s Place Autocomplete

 - Calculate distances between points

 - Store and display geolocation data

 3.Components of Integration
	1.Frontend Integration (JavaScript)
  - Google Maps is mostly integrated through JavaScript on the 
    frontend. You include the Google Maps JS API using a script tag 
    and then configure the map in your HTML/JS code.

  2.Backend (Django) Support
  - Provide location data (from the database to the frontend)

 - Store coordinates received from the frontend

 - Optionally use the Google Maps Web Services API on the backend 
   (e.g., geocoding using Python)

 4.Google Maps API Key
 - To use Google Maps, you must:

 - Go to Google Cloud Console

 - Create a project and enable Maps JavaScript API, Geocoding API, etc.

 - Generate an API key (restrict it to specific URLs for security)

 5.Common Use Cases
   1.Displaying a Map
   - Include Google Maps JavaScript API in your HTML

   - Use a div element as the map container

   - Initialize the map using coordinates

   2.Geocoding & Reverse Geocoding
   - Convert an address into latitude/longitude using the Geocoding API

   - Use Python requests or the googlemaps Python library in Django to 
     call the API

   3.Places Autocomplete
   - Add an input box in your form

   - Use the Places API to provide live address suggestions as the 
     user types

 6.Theoretical Integration Steps
 - Get an API Key from Google Cloud Console.

 - Enable APIs: JavaScript API, Geocoding API, Places API.

 - Include the API script in your HTML template:
   <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/ 
    js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>

 - Add JavaScript to load the map or autocomplete fields.

 - Use Django to:

 - Serve data to JavaScript (via templates or APIs)

 - Save user-submitted coordinates

 - Optionally use Python to call Google’s Web APIs

 7.Security Tips
 - Restrict API keys to your domain

 - Monitor usage and set quotas

 - Use environment variables to store API keys securely
