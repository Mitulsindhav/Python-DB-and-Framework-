    *** 9. URL Patterns and Template Integration *** 

(1) Setting up URL patterns in urls.py for routing requests to views. 
 -  In Django, URL patterns define how incoming requests are mapped 
    to specific views. The urls.py file handles this routing mechanism.

-=> Key Concepts:
  - URL Dispatcher – Directs requests to appropriate views based on 
    defined patterns.

 - path Function – Uses path() or re_path() to define routes.

 - Views Mapping – Connects URLs to corresponding view functions or 
   class-based views.

 - Namespace and Include – Organizes URLs using include() for 
   modular structure.

-=> Purpose: 
 - Ensures structured and maintainable URL management.

 - Allows dynamic routing using parameters.

 - Supports scalable application design by modularizing URL configurations.

(2) Integrating templates with views to render dynamic HTML content. 

-=> Key Concepts:
  - Templates – HTML files with Django template language for 
    dynamic content rendering.

 - Template Engine – Processes templates and replaces placeholders 
   with actual data.

 - Rendering Views – Views use render() to send templates as 
   HTTP responses.

 - Context Data – Views pass dynamic data to templates for display.

 - Template Inheritance – Allows reusability using base.html as a 
   parent template.

-=> Purpose:
 
 - Separates logic (views) from presentation (templates).

 - Enables dynamic content rendering based on user interactions.

 - Enhances maintainability and scalability of web applications.
