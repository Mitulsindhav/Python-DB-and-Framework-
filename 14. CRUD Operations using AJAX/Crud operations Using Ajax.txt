     *** 14. CRUD Operations using AJAX ***

(1) Using AJAX for making asynchronous requests to the server 
    without reloading the page.

  1.How AJAX Works in Django
  - User triggers an event (e.g., clicking a button, submitting a form).

 - JavaScript (or jQuery) sends an AJAX request to the Django server.

 - Django processes the request in a view and returns a response 
   (JSON, HTML, etc.).

 - JavaScript updates the page dynamically without requiring a full reload.

 2.Key Use Cases of AJAX in Django
 - Form submission without reloading (e.g., login, registration).

 - Dynamic content loading (e.g., search suggestions, comments).

 - Real-time updates (e.g., notifications, chat applications).

 3.Benefits of Using AJAX
 - Improves performance by reducing unnecessary page reloads.

 - Enhances user experience with seamless interactions.

 - Reduces server load by requesting only required data.
