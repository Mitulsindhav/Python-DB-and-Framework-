   *** 3. JavaScript with Python ***

(1)Using JavaScript for client-side interactivity in Django templates.
 - JavaScript enhances client-side interactivity in Django templates
   by handling dynamic UI updates, form validation, event handling, 
   and asynchronous data fetching.
 
 1.Role of JavaScript in Django Templates
 - Enhances User Experience: Provides real-time updates without 
   reloading  pages.
 - Event Handling: Responds to user interactions like clicks, inputs, 
   and mouse events.
 - Form Validation: Validates user input before submission.
 - AJAX and Fetch API: Communicates with Django views without reloading 
   the page.
 - DOM Manipulation: Dynamically updates HTML elements.

 2.Integrating JavaScript in Django Templates
 1️⃣ Internal JavaScript
  - JavaScript can be written inside <script> tags within the Django template.

 2️⃣ External JavaScript
  - JavaScript files are placed in the static/js/ directory.
  - {% load static %} is used to reference JavaScript files in templates. 
 
 3.Working with Django and JavaScript
 1️⃣ DOM Manipulation
  - JavaScript can modify HTML elements dynamically using document.getElementById 
    or querySelector.

 2️⃣ Event Handling
  - JavaScript listens for user interactions like clicks, keypresses, or form submissions.

 3️⃣ AJAX and Fetch API
  - JavaScript can send and receive data asynchronously using AJAX or the Fetch API, 
    reducing  server load.

 4️⃣ CSRF Token Handling
  - When sending requests to Django views using JavaScript, the CSRF token must be included 
    for security.

(2)Linking external or internal JavaScript files in Django. 
 - Django allows integrating JavaScript into templates for 
   client-side functionality. JavaScript can be included either 
   internally (within HTML files) or externally (as separate .js 
   files stored in the static/ directory).

 1.Methods to Link JavaScript in Django
 1️⃣ Internal JavaScript (Within the Template)
  - JavaScript can be written inside <script> tags directly in Django templates.
  - Typically placed in the <head> or before the closing </body> tag.

 2️⃣ External JavaScript (Using Static Files)
  - JavaScript files are stored in the static/js/ directory inside a Django app.
  - {% load static %} is required to reference static files in Django templates.
  - The <script> tag links external .js files from the static/ folder.

 2. Loading JavaScript in Django Templates
 1️⃣ Using {% load static %} for External JS
  - {% load static %} enables Django to find and serve static JavaScript files.
  - The {% static 'path/to/file.js' %} tag generates the correct URL for the JS file.

 2️⃣ Placement of JavaScript Files
  - In the <head> tag: Used for scripts that do not modify DOM elements.
  - Before </body>: Recommended for performance, as it allows HTML to load first.
