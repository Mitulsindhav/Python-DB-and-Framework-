    *** 6. Project and App Creation *** 

(1) Steps to create a Django project and individual apps within the project. 

 - Install Django – Set up Django in the environment.

 - Create a Project – Initialize a new Django project.

 - Navigate to the Project Directory – Move inside the project folder.

 - Create an App – Generate a modular app within the project.

 - Register the App – Add the app to Django’s settings.

 - Configure Database – Define models and apply migrations.

 - Create Views and URLs – Set up views and link them to URLs.

 - Run the Server – Start the Django development server.


(2) Understanding the role of manage.py, urls.py, and views.py. 

 - manage.py – A command-line utility for interacting with the 
   Django project. It is used to run the server, apply migrations, 
   create apps, and perform other administrative tasks.

 - urls.py – Handles URL routing in Django. It maps incoming requests 
   to specific views, defining how different URLs are processed within 
   the project or an app.

 - views.py – Contains the logic for handling requests and 
   returning responses. Views process data, interact with models, 
   and render templates or return JSON responses in case of APIs.
