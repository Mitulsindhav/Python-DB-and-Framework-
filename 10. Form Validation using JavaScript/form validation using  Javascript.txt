   *** 10. Form Validation using JavaScript ***

(1) Using JavaScript for front-end form validation.
 - Form validation ensures that user inputs meet specified criteria 
   before submission. JavaScript provides client-side validation to 
   improve user experience and reduce server load.

-=> Types of Form Validation:
  - Required Field Validation – Ensures fields are not left empty.

  - Pattern Validation – Uses regular expressions (regex) to 
    validate formats (e.g., email, phone number).

  - Length Validation – Checks if input meets minimum and maximum 
    length requirements.

  - Numeric Validation – Ensures numeric values fall within a valid range.

 - Real-time Validation – Provides instant feedback as users type.

-=> Purpose of JavaScript Validation:
 
 - Improves user experience by detecting errors before form submission.

 - Reduces server load by filtering invalid data on the client side.

 - Enhances security when combined with server-side validation.
